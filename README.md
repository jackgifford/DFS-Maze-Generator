# DFS-Maze-Generator
This is the repository for the first part of my Year 12 SDD Major Work.

So far the project randomly generates a maze in a user defined sized square grid. It uses Depth First Searcg, to achieve this, and the Fisher Yates algorithm to generate a random order to follow. So far this is the prototype of my year 12 Major Work, enabling me to learn about DFS, and the various other algorithms I'll need to use, over time the application will become more refined.
