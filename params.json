{"name":"DFS Maze Generator","tagline":"The prototype behind my 12 SSD Major Work","body":"# DFS-Maze-Generator\r\nThis is the repository for the first part of my Year 12 SDD Major Work.\r\n\r\nSo far the project randomly generates a maze in a user defined sized square grid. It uses Depth First Search, to achieve this, and the Fisher Yates algorithm to generate a random order to follow. So far this is the prototype of my year 12 Major Work, enabling me to learn about DFS, and the various other algorithms I'll need to use, over time the application will become more refined.\r\n\r\nFor More Infromation:\r\n* [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)\r\n* [Maze Generation Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)\r\n* [Fisher Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
